# research_project

Here is the repository for my final project. You will find the following documents and folders:
+ data_raw : a csv file with the data that Joseph created ('attitude_data.csv').
+ data_tidy : two csv files - one with the tidy data ('attitude_tidy.csv') and another one with the new variables ('attitude_final.csv')
+ manuscript: an Rmarkdown document ('manuscript.Rmd') along with the word document of the manuscript ('manuscript.docx').
+ slides: an Rmarkdown document ('slides.Rmd') along with the html version of the slides presented in class ('slides.html').
+ 'code.R': the code I created for my project - from the data visualization to the testing of main effects and the checking of the model diagnostics.
